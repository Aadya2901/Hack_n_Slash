## Inspiration
Mental health is one of the most crucial yet often overlooked aspects of well-being. Recognizing this, we were inspired to create an accessible and user-friendly solution. Our goal is to provide comprehensive support through an app that combines educational resources, self-care tools, and therapy support, encouraging users to prioritize their mental health.

## What it does
Our app is designed to promote therapy and self-care awareness for mental health, offering a supportive platform to enhance well-being. Through engaging resources, guided exercises, and mood tracking, users can gain insight into their emotional health and build healthy habits. The app provides self-help techniques, mindfulness exercises, and motivational reminders to foster personal growth. Additionally, it offers an anonymous space to access mental health tips and connect with licensed therapists if needed. By combining self-care tools with therapy awareness, the app empowers users to prioritize mental health and build a balanced lifestyle, addressing mental wellness in an accessible, user-friendly way.

## How we built it
Currently, we have developed a comprehensive idea and a detailed flowchart for our mental health and therapy app. While we are still in the early stages of development and do not yet possess all the technical skills required to build the app, we are eager to learn and grow. Our initial focus has been on conceptualizing the app's features, user experience, and overall functionality. We plan to continue enhancing our skills and collaborating with experienced developers to bring our vision to life.
